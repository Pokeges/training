How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- find solutions I had earlier faster.
- find changes in the code faster
- blablabla

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

+ logical intervals of code changes
- might forget to saveg

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- because Google Docs does not think I work on interrelated files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 
 - no mouse in Windows Command Line and no copy shortcut - extremely anoying
 - used GIT GUI to do the job - not pretty, but without stupid clicking somewhere...
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 
 - hahaha funny question! Think this is the core of VC
 
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- Working on my Mashine Learning Course at UDACITY
